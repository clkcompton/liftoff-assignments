# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Weather Planning Application

### Overview

Description:
A weather app that lets the user search future dates for their ideal weather scenario.

Example: I want to plan a time to go camping but am reliant on the weather. With the app, I could select my ideal camping weather conditions - no rain, on a weekend, sunny, low wind - and the app will show me which upcoming dates meet my requirements.

	* Edit/delete weather preferences
	* Select the fields to be edited/deleted
* User entry/drop down selections for weather conditions
	* Activity name, temperature, precipitation, sunny/cloudy, wind
* Calling a weather API and comparing it to the user's selected weather preferences 
	* API will search at least a week into the future for the selected criteria

	* Easy to read, labeled results

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
I have to learn how to call the weather API and search the contents to compare it against the user's preferences.
I also have to further research and learn how to connect the database of the user's weather preferences to my JS file.
